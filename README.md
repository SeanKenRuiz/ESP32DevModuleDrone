# ESP32DevModuleDrone
A quadcopter drone that uses a ESP32 Dev Module as its microcontroller

I've taken the code from Carbon Aeronautics [quadcopter drone repositories]((https://github.com/CarbonAeronautics)), and adadpted it to work with the ESP32.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions regarding the concepts, code, or set-up!
